I'm a German consultant who finished his studies and started working. First and foremost, I develop PL/SQL code in Oracle databases. During my studies, I was always thankfull about all the helpfull blogposts about IT stuff. Nearly every IT problem seems to appear in the internet. THIS IS GREAT! I created this website in order to also share some solutions of the daily „problems“ I am facing at the moment…maybe it is nothing spectacular – but hopefully it can help others.

Let’s see if I find time to share as much as possible :-)
