Hello World! This is me: [Jonas Gassenmeyer](https://de.linkedin.com/in/jonas-gassenmeyer-804174125)

I'm a German consultant who finished his studies and started working. First and foremost, I develop PL/SQL code in Oracle databases. During my studies, I was always thankfull about all the helpfull blogposts about IT stuff. Nearly every IT problem seems to appear in the internet. THIS IS GREAT! I created those github pages in order to also share some solutions as well…maybe it is nothing spectacular – but hopefully it can help others.

Let’s see if I find time to share as much as possible :-)

My other "me" when I do not sit in front of my PC:
I am a [Basketball Refree](http://www.sv-dreieichenhain.de/abteilungen/basketball/die-abteilung/ansprechpartner/) and I love to play this Sport! 

My Twitter Handle is [@gassenmj](https://twitter.com/gassenmj)
